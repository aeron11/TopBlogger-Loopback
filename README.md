# My Application

The project is generated by [LoopBack](http://loopback.io).

## Security

Everything is centered around blogs. Any one can view a blog.
Once logged in via Oauth, a user can create new blogs, edit their existing authored blogs, comment on blogs and vote on blogs. Users should be able to mark a blog as inappropriate and vote it up or down (only once). If logged in, they can add a comment and like a comment that is not their own.
